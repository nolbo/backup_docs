Therefore, JavaScript is not shortened to Java.\n* JavaScript used in the Kakao Talk bot is a JavaScript engine named Rhino, not pure JavaScript. Therefore, Kakao Talk bot does not provide the same function as alert().\n* Be sure to know the basic grammar of JavaScript.\nKakao Talk bot\n\nKakao Talk bot is an automatic response bot that automatically responds to Kakao Talk. Messenger bot R, chatting robot, etc. are used to develop Kakao Talk. This page is based on Messenger BotR.\noperating principle\n\nThe Messenger Bot parses alerts through NotificationListenerService, and then uses the Rhino JavaScript Engine to forward and process alert information to a JavaScript that you created. Finally, you will use a WearableExtender to reply.\nresponse function\n\nThis is the basic event listener that is called when the app successfully parses notifications from user-specified KakaoTalk.\nfunction response (room, msg, sender, isGroupChat, supplier, imageDB, packageName){\n/*Enter source here*/\n}\nparameter name format function\nRoom String Returns the name of the room in string format.\nmsg String returns the message in string format.\nReturns the name of the sender of the sender string message in string format.\nisGroupChat Boolean Returns the room in a group chat format called or not.\nSupplier void Returns the session of the corresponding room.\nimageDB - Returns the imageDB.\nIn order to use the above parameters, the source code must be created inside the response function. (If not, a referenceError, that is, a reference error, will occur.)\nTo receive\nReceiving function is the basic and core function of Kakao Talk bot. The code with the receive function is as follows.\nsupplier.reply (String msg); //msg transmission\nsupplier.reply (String room, String msg, Boolean HideToast = false); //send msg to the room. Returns true on successful transfer or false on failed transfer.\nApi.replyRoom(String room, String msg, Boolean HideToast = false); //send msg to the room. Returns true on successful transfer or false on failed transfer.\nWeb parsing\nInformation such as weather can be delivered through web parsing. But be careful of security when you're web parsing.\nUtils.getWebText (String url); //Load HTML on the address homepage and return it as a string\nUtils.parse (String url); //get HTML from the address homepage of url and return it to org.jsoup.nodes.Document\nAfter Web parsing, you need to be able to get only the information you need. What makes this more convenient is Jsoup. This will be covered in more detail in > Jsoup.\nApi\nAmong legacy Api, Api contains the basic functions of the bot.\nName Format Description\nGetContext() android.Content.Context Get the context of the app.\nreload()\ncompile() Boolean Re-compiles all scripts. The return value is always true.\nreload (String scriptName, Boolean rowOneError = false)\ncompile (String scriptName, Boolean throughOnError = false) Boolean specific to Boolean.\nIf rowOneError is true, then thumb the compilation error exception.\nReturns false when an error occurs, or the script does not exist, and returns true when compilation is successful.\nPrepare (String scriptName) int compiles only if the script has never been compiled.\nThrows error when compilation fails, 0 if script does not exist, 1 if compilation is successful, and 2 if compilation has been done once.\nUnload (String scriptName) Boolean puts the script in an uncompiled state.\nReturns false if originally uncompiled, if script does not exist, or true if not.\noff() Power off all scripts. The return value is always true.\noff (String scriptName) Boolean Power off the corresponding script.\nScript does not exist, or Api in script settings.Returns false if off() is set to ignore; otherwise, true.\non() Power on all scripts. The return value is always true.\non (String scriptName) Boolean Power on the corresponding script.\nReturns false if script does not exist, true if present.\nisOn (String scriptName) Boolean Returns the power state of that script.\nisCompiled (String scriptName) Boolean Returns whether the script has been compiled or not.\nisCompiling (String scriptName) Boolean Returns whether the script is recognized during compilation.\ngetScriptNames() String[] returns the names of all scripts to an array.\nReplyRoom (String room, String message)\nReplyRoom (String room, String message, Boolean HideToast = false) sends a message to the corresponding room. If the hideToast is true, it does not float the toast without a room session.\nReturns true if room session exists, false if none. (This indicates whether the transfer was successful in normal circumstances.)\ncanReply (String room) Boolean Returns whether messages can be sent to the corresponding room.\nShowToast (String content, int length) Generate a void toast message.\nMakeNoti (String Title, String content, int id) String[] notification. id value is the unique ID of the alert.\nApi with the same ID.If you call makeNoti again, the notification will not appear new and the content will be modified.\npapagoTranslate (String sourceLanguage, String targetLanguage, String content)\nPapagTranslate (String sourceLanguage, String targetLanguage, String content, Boolean errorToString = false) String translation results are provided.\nIf errorToString is true, return the error to String without scrolling.\ngc() Force garbage collection.\nRun the func function in the UITHread void UI thread.\nThe onCompletion function has an error, result factor, and the error object is delivered to the error in case of an error after execution of the func function.\nPasses the return value to the result if it runs successfully.\ngetActiveThreadsCound (String scriptName) int returns the number of active threads in that script. If you do not provide scriptName, the script that invokes this function is specified.\ninterruptThreads (String scriptName) voids an interrupt request to threads in that script. If you do not provide scriptName, the script that called this function is specified.\nisTerminated (String scriptName) Boolean Api.After interruptThreads, make sure that all threads are interrupt. If you do not provide scriptName, the script that invokes this function is specified.\nUtils\nUtils of Legacy Api provides basic and useful functions for bot production.\nName Format Description\nGetWebText (String url) Load HTML from the String website and return it as a string. (Sync)\nparse (String url) get HTML from the org.jsoup.nodes website and return it to org.jsoup.nodes.Document (Sync)\ngetAndroidVersionCode() in app-driven environment returns Android version code.\nGetAndroidVersionName() Returns the Android version name of the String app operating environment."
